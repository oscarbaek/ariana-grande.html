  <p>Heaven sent you to me
  I'm just hopin' I don't repeat history
  Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
  Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah-ah)
  Never need no (no), no one else, babe
  'Cause I'll be
  Switchin' the positions for you
  Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
  I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
  Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
  That I won't do, switchin' for you</p>
  <p>Perfect, perfect
  You're too good to be true (you're too good to be true)
  But I get tired of runnin'
  Fuck it, now I'm runnin' with you (wit' you)
  Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
  Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah-ah)
  Never need no (no), no one else, babе</p>
